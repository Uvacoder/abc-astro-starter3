Easily the largest project I have worked on. The City of Langford required a new timesheet system to replace their old, unmaintainabe system. My job entailed respecifying the requirements of a new system and then designing and building said system. The final product was a new timesheet system writtin in React, using NodeJS for the API, and integrating with a Microsoft SQL Sever. The app leverages Azure technologies for authentication, and deployment. Now if that sounded like non-sense, just know, this was hard and took a long time.
